## The History of Linux 

#### Bell Labs
It start  with the Inventor Of Telephone that Created Bell Labs and its Search on Communication and Mathematical theory of Communication and its the Opening of Information Theory ...
////////////////////////////////////
**ARPA** Advanced Research Project Agency 
**DARPA**

Project **MAC** => Mathematics and Computation and its Goal Is Time Sharing In OS that can make Many Programmers to Enter PC Remotely and Make many Instruction in Same Time  and this Opposite of Batch  Processing
and The Result of BIG MAC is TSS => Time Sharing System and The Result is OS is **CTSS** => Compatible Time Sharing System

---
> **The Collaboration OF Bill Lab && General Electric for Mainframes **

and this Enter Terminal New That Remote and Connect  To MainFrames so this 
Called **Telly Type Writer =>TTY**
The Result of This Collobration is **MULTiCX** => Multiplex Information and Computation Service and its  Features ** ( Remote Terminal , Continouse Operation ,Internal File System ,Concurrent Application)**

## UNIX 
Made In Bell Labs and First Two Version OF it Written in Assembly language then It Written In C

#### problem in UNIX using Assembley 
in Assembly is low Level that translate to Machine Code and Related To Hardware so It related To Microprocessor and its Family 
So that For Every Different  Microprocessor i need To make Different UNIX Version That Compatible to that MICRO and Were The Hero Come dn dn dn ITS C Language  :)


#### UNIX is Expensive Who Saves Us from this 
So the Unix Is turned to Product that Even Collegue in After Period must Buy It to Study So 
The Saviour that is Techear From Holanda !!! He Makes From The Start OS Version Depend On UNIX named it MINX and make it Free For Universites around World 
##### is the Movment Of free Software develop more ??
so Also Included of People that See that Software Must Be Free is also Movment Named
> **Free Software Movment **
- and its demand for Four Things 
- Free Software to ON 
- Free To Study 
- Free to Modify 
- Free to Share
> then The movment Is Spread around the world and The Begging of OPEN Source 
- To Develop Software To all **GNU** like Bash Shell and C Compiler

#### Finally Linux 
While Studing  Minix OS he see it Difficult to Study and maitain so he Make Linux
