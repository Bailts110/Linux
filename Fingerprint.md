When you connect to an SSH server for the first time, or if the server's identity has changed, your SSH client displays a message like this:

```
The authenticity of host '4.236.152.79 (<IP_ADDRESS>)' can't be established.
SHA256 Fingerprint: <long_string_of_characters>
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Let's break down what this means:

### What is a Fingerprint?

An **SSH fingerprint** is a short, unique identifier for the SSH server's **public key**.

- **Public Key Cryptography:** SSH uses public-key cryptography to establish a secure, encrypted connection. Every SSH server has a pair of cryptographic keys: a **private key** (kept secret on the server) and a **public key** (which the server shares with clients).
- **Hash Function:** A fingerprint is essentially a **hash** (a one-way mathematical function) of the server's public key. This hash is much shorter and easier to compare than the full public key, while still being virtually unique.
- **SHA256:** This specifies the hashing algorithm used. SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a strong cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit hash value, commonly represented as a long string of hexadecimal characters or base64 encoded characters. Newer SSH clients prefer SHA256 over older, less secure algorithms like MD5.

### Why does it give you this fingerprint?

The primary reason SSH gives you this fingerprint is for **security and to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.**

Here's how it works:

1. **First Connection:** When you connect to an SSH server for the very first time, your client has no prior record of that server's public key. It receives the public key from the server and calculates its fingerprint. Since it's new, it prompts you to verify if you trust this new host.
2. **Verification:** The *ideal* scenario is that you somehow obtain the legitimate fingerprint of the server *out-of-band* (meaning, through a separate, trusted channel). This could be:
	- From the server administrator (e.g., they email it to you, or publish it on a secure website).
	- By physically being at the server and running a command like `ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub` to see its actual fingerprint.
	- If the server is well-known (like GitHub), their official documentation will provide the fingerprints.
3. **Trusting the Host:** If the fingerprint displayed by your SSH client matches the legitimate fingerprint you've obtained, you can type `yes` to confirm. Your SSH client will then store this fingerprint (and the full public key) in your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file.
4. **Subsequent Connections:** For all future connections to that same server (4.236.152.79), your SSH client will compare the fingerprint it receives from the server with the one stored in your `known_hosts` file.
	- **Match:** If they match, the connection proceeds automatically and securely.
	- **Mismatch:** If they *don't* match, your SSH client will issue a strong warning, often telling you that "REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!" and refusing to connect until you manually intervene.

### Why is this important (Man-in-the-Middle Attack)?

This fingerprint verification process is crucial for preventing **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks**.

Imagine this scenario:

- You want to connect to your legitimate server (Server A).
- An attacker (Server B) intercepts your connection attempt.
- Instead of connecting you to Server A, the attacker's Server B pretends to be Server A.
- If there were no fingerprint verification, your client might unknowingly connect to Server B. All your commands, passwords, and data would then be sent to the attacker, who could log them, modify them, or use them to gain unauthorized access to your actual server.

The fingerprint acts as a digital "ID card" for the server. If the ID card changes unexpectedly, it's a huge red flag that something is wrong. While a changed fingerprint can sometimes be legitimate (e.g., the server was reinstalled, or its host keys were rotated), it's *always* worth investigating to ensure you're not falling victim to an MITM attack.

**In your case:**

Since it's likely your first time connecting to `4.236.152.79`, your SSH client is just doing its job by asking you to confirm the authenticity of this new host. If you trust the owner of `4.236.152.79` and know it's the correct server, you can type `yes` to proceed.
